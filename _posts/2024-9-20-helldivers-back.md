We are so back.

I can slam recoilless rounds and shots from my eruptor like its nothing. I can make it through a mission without crashing. Things feel good. Of course, one is still squishy as hell, however you are no longer mobbed by things you have no way of dealing with. 

That, and the 500KG bomb. It destroys. 

This is the sort of power and gameplay I was advertized.

Get us those performance fixes and the golden goose is back.
