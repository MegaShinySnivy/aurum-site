As in the title, I've came up with a few new forms... or rather, had a few new forms given to me. One, as longtime followers will be unsuprised to hear, is a sort of cat taur form. A mix of my feral and nonferal stormtrooper forms, this allows me to carry more without sacreficing speed, at the cost of an overall more bulky frame. As other longtime followers will know, my core absorbs magic. Well, I finally figured out what happens when I absorb a large amount in a short span of time. My body warps, the metal unable to keep up with the strain, and I have to force the mess of parts that is myself into a form that at least is somewhat recognizable. In my case, a dragon.
