As in the title, I've came up with a few new forms... or rather, had a few new forms given to me. One, as longtime followers will be unsuprised to hear, is a sort of cat taur form. A mix of my feral and nonferal stormtrooper forms, this allows me to carry more without sacreficing speed, at the cost of an overall more bulky frame. As other longtime followers will know, my core absorbs magic. Well, I finally figured out what happens when I absorb a large amount in a short span of time. My body warps, the metal unable to keep up with the strain, and I have to force the mess of parts that is myself into a form that at least is somewhat recognizable. In my case, a dragon. 

You may ask: What? And why?

To which I would respond with more details.

STRMTaur is a variant of my stormtrooper, with a proper human torso in place of part of the back and head. This gives me the speed of the stormtrooper with the ability to use my claws. It also comes with a size increase, allowing me to compete for size with larger machines.

The Light That Burns The Sky takes the form of a large western style dragon, with large wings and magic light leaking from the armor plates. This form was created after my partner attempted to kill me with an overflow of magical energy (still love you though <3), and as a result is more chaotic, made of metal spatter and warped plates.
