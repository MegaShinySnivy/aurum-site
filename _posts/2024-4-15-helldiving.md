This game sucks. I love it.

No, seriously. That is the post. Go explore nature.

You want more detail? Fine.

Helldivers is a game that has a good soul, if it could stop tripping over its own feet. There is clearly a team with a lot of heart, that wants to show what a Live Service game could be, with a live war and evolving story, lacking the more predatory aspects of most games. However, with the balance issues and recent fuckups with the PSN and performance, it keeps it from being a truly *good* game, one that can hold my attention.

If they want some advice:

* Stop nerfing all the fun toys, balance from the bottom up and give me more reasons to vary my loadout.<sup>1</sup>
* Focus on fixing the game-breaking and performance bugs. Love the DoT fixes, more of those please.<sup>2</sup>
* Slow down on pushing new things out the door, and shore up code quality. Unrelated changes should not break unrelated things.<sup>3</sup>
* If you want us to use our strategems against heavy enemies, stop making us unable to use them all the time,<sup>4</sup> or give us more ways to temporarily deal with them while they're in effect.<sup>5</sup>

Fix these and I think Arrowhead and their leach, Sony, will have a golden goose able to provide long after the game should be dead.


#### notes
1. Balancing from the bottom up means to buff the weaker things before nerfing the stronger things
2. We have a 6900XT and a Threadripper. Any frame drops are on the game at this point.
3. Hulks, in spite of not being changed in the past 3 paches, have had their damage change over that time.
4. As an example, Ion Storms (which can break some mission strategems like the miner), Anti Aircraft, and longer call in times
5. I know the stun grenades are a thing. But they should not be the only option to get a swarm of everything off of you.
