title: So who am I?
---
My name is Aurum. I'm an automaton created around 1546, designed to defend VIPs and other members of note. I now relax with my partners, Jinx and Ellie in the modern day.

I enjoy coffee, sparing, and cuddling with my parners, along with military science and strategy, mechanical design, and history.
